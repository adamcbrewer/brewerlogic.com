				I had a great time working alongside <a href="http://lovecravendale.co.uk/humans.txt" title="humans" target="_blank">
				several developers</a> for this project while enjoying my time working
				for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in London.

				The site is a loyalty scheme encouraging users to collect codes printed on bottle labels purchased
				in-store and exchanged for various prizes and promotions on the site. The value of the prizes
				increasing the number of codes required.
			</p>
			<p>
				I had the privilage of building the code redemption part of the site, working closely
				with the back-end developer and the UX designer to create an easy to use and
				interesting process for users collect codes and redeem them for prizes.
			</p>
			<p>
				My favourite part was playing around with loads of little subtle animations and transitions, all
				through the use of CSS and controlling those animation states with Javascript when required.
