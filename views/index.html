					Brewer Logic is the porfolio of web developer Adam Brewer.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm a fervent front-end Web Developer and Webmaker whose passion lies in
					all things Javascript, HTML and CSS. I have a fairly comprehensive front-end
					skill set with some back-end experience as well. I'm always eager to learn
					anything new.
				</p>
				<p>
					I build semantic, mobile-responsive websites and apps optimised for both speed
					and performance, utilising good front-end practices and complying with modern
					web standards and features.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aside from the Internet, my other interests include running, reading, wine and Paleo food. I used to be
					an Aircraft Technician in the British Army so I have quite a few stories to tell!
				</p>
				<p>
					This site went through many trials and versions. I had some crazy ideas for it, but in the end
					I realised its sole purpose is to represent myself and the work I've done, including the web development principles I stand by.
					Fast, lean and flexible. Simplicity is always a sure thing. <a target="_blank" href="/humans.txt">You can find its more technical stuff here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have my own ideas about browser support for this site, and using the <a target="_blank" href="http://caniuse.com/classlist">HTML5 classList API</a> rules
					out <=IE9. I didn't see the value in bloating the dependancies from using a heavy library, however
					I'll probably find a work around at some point, just to learn how to do it.
