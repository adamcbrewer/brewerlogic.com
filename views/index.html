								I had a great time working alongside <a href="http://lovecravendale.co.uk/humans.txt" title="humans" target="_blank">
								several developers</a> for this project while enjoying my time working
								for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in London.

								The site is a loyalty scheme encouraging users to collect codes printed on bottle labels purchased
								in-store and exchanged for various prizes and promotions on the site. The value of the prizes
								increasing the number of codes required.
							</p>
							<p>
								I had the privilage of building the code redemption part of the site, working closely
								with the back-end developer and the UX designer to create an easy to use and
								interesting process for users collect codes and redeem them for prizes.
							</p>
							<p>
								My favourite part was playing around with loads of little subtle animations and transitions, all
								through the use of CSS and controlling those animation states with Javascript when required.
