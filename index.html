                <div class="project-copy">
                    <p>I've long been an admirer of Ash's work; his illustrations are amazing and most of my favourite Sci-fi films feature his UI concepts and title designs.</p>
                    <p>
                        We initially discussed what Ash wanted from his site: updates to the existing system which were going
                        to be hackey and less than ideal at best. With a weekend at our
                        disposal before his big <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ashthorp.com/project-2501---homage-to-ghost-in-the-shell">Ghost
                        in the Shell homage</a> launch (<a href="http://www.gits2501.com/" target="_blank" >official site here</a>), I set about
                        building a new site for him (both CMS and front-end) while he updated all his portfolio pieces to fit the new design. Needless
                        to say we both had very little sleep that weekend, but I was very pleased with the result in the end considering the time constraints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The site received so many hits that week it crashed. To improve efficiency, I replaced
                        the CMS three times in total over the course of the next week (due to various functionality and performance reasons).
                        Eventually I stuck with <a href="http://getkirby.com/" target="_blank">Kirby</a>, which allowed a few more customizations
                        and also came with a very nice GUI admin module.

                    <p>
                        Working is a pleasure when it's for something or someone you admire, but doing a job for someone who also has a very high work ethic is a bonus.

                    <p>
                        Mallorca Property Concierge was a rebuild-from-scratch job which I had the pleasure
                        of working on with two others – <a href="http://tooandflow.com/" target="_blank">Kris (designer)</a> and <a href="http://pierre.io/" target="_blank">Pierre (back-end developer)</a> – to produce
                        a massive site, both in terms of visuals and functionality, for an independent agency who purchase
                        properties in Mallorca for private clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kris has a strong background in Motion Graphics, which showed through in his concepts for the site.
                        Building the site and making it accessible for touch devices was also loads of fun. The trickiest
                        bit was <a href="www.mallorcapropertyconcierge.com/the-island" target="_blank">the Map/Island page</a>, which really tested me in building the detailed SVG 'dot' map. This feature had to
                        link up with the CMS locations, content imagery for the Island areas which were shown in separate (but
                        co-functioning) carousel and Google Map of the chosen area. The back-end was written by Pierre, using Drupal – a
                        highly customised CMS to serve the front-end's pages and an API to mainly serve the Map/Island page's components.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having all the images throughout managed via the CMS meant that image optimisations weren't possible long-term, something
                        which I would have normally stressed the importance of, for performance reasons. However, the high standards from
                        both Pierre and Kris meant quite a bit of front-end refactoring, which made this site one I'm very proud of.

Jake's a designer — meaning we're talking designer quality images here — so I decided to reduce the amount of inital asset requests (to improve overall speed) and conditionally load them for selected projects. This method meant that the core application needed quite a bit of asynchronous thinking.</p><p>Because of the planning involved between the two of us — regarding performance and the number of requests — the site was a natural fit to make responsive and device agnostic; great attention to detail was paid to mobile usability. The perceived speed is amazing, in terms of both load times and interface feedback, on any device.</p>

                    <p>This site was vastly different to anything I had made before while working at Outside Line. The size of the assets, the traffic generated and the experience we tried to deliver was a massive challange. I was excited from day one!</p><p>The site was very image heavy and the designer's intention was to deliver a skeuomorphic experience following the brand's guidelines for the promotional straw sets that Cravendale were offering in exchange for collecting codes, which were printed and sold on bottles across the UK.</p><p>Both the designer and I came up with an idea to simulate a 3-dimentional display of the straw sets using a series of images of each set, themselves modelled and rendered in 3D. The result was a combination of simple, 2D image replacement which gave an impressive, realistic 3D effect.</p><p>Everything had to be built to give a complete experience, meaning even the YouTube player UI had to be built from scratch. In our workflow we ran our images through PunyPNG image compression and used CodeKit to minify and compress all our Javascript and CSS, all of which was served through an Amazon S3 CDN.</p><p>It was the biggest site, with regards to traffic, that I had the pleasure in working on, not to mention celebratory drinks afterwards.</p>

                        and performance, utilising good front-end practices and complying with modern
                        web standards and features.

                        Aside from the Internet, my other interests include running, reading, wine and Paleo food. I used to be
                        an Aircraft Technician in the British Army so I have quite a few stories to tell! I'm very outgoing and love
                        big trips and adventures; I recently finished a 6,000 mile road trip around the Western USA, sailed across
                        the Atlantic, run a 100 mile race, been skydiving over Las Vegas and done the highest bungee in the world (when it was, at least!).
                        I can also appreciate a really good meme or GIF.
