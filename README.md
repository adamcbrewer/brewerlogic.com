## Getting Started

Firstly, run the following:

```
$ chmod +x ./init.sh ./update-submodules.sh ./update-permissions.sh
$ ./init.sh
$ ./update-submodules.sh
$ ./update-permissions.sh
```

This should install all the required files (npm & bower) and copy any initial bower dependencies to get you started. 

Additionally, the `update-submodules.sh` and `update-permissions.sh` scripts are run as well to make sure you have everything CMS related and to set the correct file permissions to use the CMS.

You'll also want to grab a copy of `app/content/` from wherever they're edited â€“ ask someone for the latest files.
