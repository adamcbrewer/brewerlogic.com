Personal portfolio website for Adam Brewer, senior full-stack developer based in Bristol, UK.

## About Me

I enjoy building things with JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Node.js—whether that's enterprise fintech platforms, design systems, or side projects with my brother.

My focus is on creating robust component systems, clean APIs, and interfaces that just work. I care about performance, accessibility, and writing code that other developers actually want to maintain.

Previously served as an Aircraft Technician in the British Army before moving into web development in 2010.

### Co-founder

I co-founded [Paper Trails](https://papertrails.io) with my brother [Jake](https://studiobrewer.com)—a platform for creating custom art prints from your Strava and adventure data.

### Beyond Code

Running, climbing, cycling, woodworking, reading, and anything with an 80s aesthetic.

## Tech Stack

This site is a simple static HTML/CSS/JS portfolio with:

- Dark/light theme toggle
- Intersection Observer for active nav states
- CSS custom properties for theming
- No build tools, no frameworks—just the basics
