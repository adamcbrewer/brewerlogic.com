November 2012

Virgin Galactic is running a campaign in orer to sell relatively affordable tickets for a seat for a ride into space. Having a very comprehensive site already, I was tasked with building a site to reach their mobile customers.

A standalone mobile site was agreed upon, as well as a modest amount of parallax elements to accompany the flight information and registration form.

In order to achieve the parallax effect and still maniplulate elements on the page, the native touch-scroll was removed and replaced with a third party library to simulate it. Having said that, navigating form elements while native functionality has been replaced is a nightmare, not to mention encountering several edge case issues.

While I wouldn't personally agree with a standalone site, or parallax features for touch devices, the build was fun and I learnt a hell of a lot concerning mobile interaction and caveats.
